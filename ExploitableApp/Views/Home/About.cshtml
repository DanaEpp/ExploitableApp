<h2>About the Exploitable App</h2>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
    <big>
        Welcome to the <a href="http://exploitable.app">Exploitable App</a>. This application has been created as a sandbox for web application penetration testing. Hidden within this application are numerous flaws which should allow you the opportunity to test your skills as a hacker or fine-tune your craft as a security professional.
    </big>
</p>
<p>
    <big>
        I would suggest having a look at the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project" id="owasp">OWASP Top 10 Project</a> as you are sure to find a few of those vulnerabilities here.
    </big>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
    <big>
        There is only one rule when it comes to hacking the <a href="http://exploitable.app">Exploitable App</a>, be creative! There are countless ways that this application can be exploited but each vulnerability that exists has been crafted in such a way that you should need minimal tools, save the browser you are reading this page from. What are you waiting for? Right click, and view page source already...or inspect it w/ dev tools...

            if (console) console.log({ 'Pro Tip #1': 'Remember the Dev Tools & Console are your friend!' });
            //OK, You get the first 1 for free - there is a vulnerable query string parameter that can be passed to exploit an XSS vulnerability. 
            //And the query string parameter name is owasp (ex. /home/about?owasp=blah) <-- I can't be more clear here...
            //Still need more help? Try this --> /Home/About?owasp=OWASP Top 10 Project%27%20;alert(%27XXS!!%27);//
